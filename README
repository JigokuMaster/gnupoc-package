GnuPoc package
==============


This is a collection of patched tools and scripts for compiling them,
for building symbian applications. It also contains patches for different
S60 and UIQ SDKs, to enable building in unix-like environments.

The main goal of this project is to be able to build symbian software
packages with as little modifications to the actual code to be built
as possible.

First you need to install a toolchain, see tools/README. Then you can
install one or more SDKs, according to the instructions in sdks/README.
